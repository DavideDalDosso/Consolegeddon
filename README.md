# Consolegeddon

Known bugs:
Lag: causing the game to accidentally not tag properly causing them to not be targeted by turrets nor count towards defeat;
Causing the game to believe there are no miners nor turrets in field causing it to have the base cost.

Right click somehow is automatically binded to [E] which causes to put walls.

Left click causes the program to lag until next input which allows to artificially cause the previously lag related issues to occur on command.


TODO:
Change the method of drawing characters a little to prevent the program from slowing down when many objects appear.
